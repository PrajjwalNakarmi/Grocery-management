                        Technology is constantly changing the way we live in our daily life completely. From the complex
                        daily activities like bioengineering, rocket science,
                        etc.to simple online shopping in e-commerce websites, we rely on technology every second of our
                        life. In a way, technology has helped to bring the
                        world closer and better connected among us. Technology doesn't always have to be flashy big
                        machines or bright screens on our electronic devices.
                        It could be as simple as a water pump or a simple pulley, telling us that technology is, in
                        simple words, the invention of machines or groups of
                        machines that help us do our jobs efficiently and easily.There are tons of types of technology
                        such as Communication Technology, Entertainment
                        Technology, BioTechnology, Robotics, Electronics, Artificial Intelligence, and much
                        more.Electical gadgets, faster modes of communication, and
                        transport have added so much comfort in our lives. It has brought the chance of an individual
                        becoming maximum productible. Technology has
                        brought a revolution in many operational fields. While it seems technology has lots of positives
                        and benefits, there are also lots of drawbacks and negative impacts of technology which we will
                        be discussing down below in detail.

                    <h2>Positive Impact Of Technology</h2>
                    <p class="content">
                        In this modern era, we cannot live without technology.It has became a essential element of out
                        life. And why wouldn't it be? It has so many positives in our lives. Starting with Communication
                        Technology, probably one of the most, if not the most useful invention of technology has helped
                        us to be connected with people from the other side of our big world.Before there was no actual
                        proper way for us to communicate with people far from us except for letter, which are really
                        inconvinient.
                        But now the help of Communication Technology, it's hundred times easier to tranmit data from one
                        place to another and you could also communicate using different social media apps like whatsapp,
                        skype, etc. plus the new 5g makes it even faster and easier to communicate. Moreover, Japan
                        recently, introduces an innovative prototype showcasing the immense capabilities of 6G
                        technology.
                        <br>
                        With the help of technology, it is now very easy for a person to find any source of
                        entertainment in the ineternet. With the increase of growth of quality of movies, video games,
                        virtual reality(VR), modern museums,etc it is very easier for a person to be entertained at all
                        times. Every company, every students, every parents utilizes Entertainment Technology to enjoy
                        their free times without being bored.
                        <br>
                        One of the other advantages of technology is Automation, Technology helps people to do the
                        repetitive and mundane tasks without much trouble. Automation helps to improve productivity and
                        reduces errors in different industries such as manufacturing, engineering, logistics,
                        agriculture and many more industries have benefited from automated processes, reducing the need
                        for manual labor. This results in increased precision, consistency, and a reduction in workplace
                        injuries as well.
                        <br>
                        Lastly Aritifical Intelligence(AI),AI offers a range of benefits to technology. It helps with
                        automation, making workflows smoother and cutting down on mistakes. It's also great at handling
                        big datasets fast, and make smarter choices.Plus, AI can personalize services based on what
                        individuals like, which can really improve user experiences. Overall, AI has the potential to
                        completely change different industries, encouraging innovation and creating new opportunities
                        for growth.For example:AI is transforming online shopping. When we look for shoes, AI suggests
                        styles based on our preferences. It also helps the stores stock the right items, boosting
                        satisfaction. AI's personalization and efficiency are improving the shopping experience.

                    <h2>Negative Impact Of Technology</h2>
                    <p class="content">
                        Having so much positives doesn't overlap the negatives of technology. While using Technology,
                        there is always high chance of your data to be leaked or destroyed anytime. Those valuable datas
                        and information, if gets in the wrong hand could be very dangerous, especially with the amount
                        of online cyber crimes like cyber bullying, blackmailing, Cyberstalking, etc happening every
                        second,in every corner of the world which are ignored and not considered.
                        Another negative impact could be unemployment, we have seen seeing the trend for a lot of ears
                        now that machines and robots being able to task faster and easier than people who made the
                        machines. Because of this, there is high chance that the robots completely replace human being
                        in the near future. For example: Lots of people prefer online shopping making the people not
                        using the technology harder to run a sucessful marketplace.
                        <br>
                        People are also being less and less creative as they are being completely dependent upon
                        technology. Becoming lazy and destroying their own health. Manipulating Digital Media, creating
                        fake personas, fake news and much more negative inpacts exists while using technology.
                        <br>
                        Additionally, technology's rapid advancement raises fears of job displacement due to automation
                        and artificial intelligence. It's crucial for individuals, industries, and governments to
                        address these challenges through responsible use, regulation, and ethical considerations to
                        ensure that the negative impacts are minimized while maximizing the benefits of technology.
